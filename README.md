**Team Name:** GoCO

**Team Members:** [Becks Boone][10], [Lakshmi Kollengode][11]

## Purpose 1
To understand the current water scenario in the state of CO with focus on use for Domestic and Irrigation purposes and how the changing population affects this.

## Purpose 2 
To educate ourselves, our communities, and decisionmakers about the 6 conclusions from the [EPA's 2016 Study of Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas and Its Potential Impact on Drinking Water Resources][1]. Make the conclusions actionable by using Colorado data to examine regions of Colorado in an easy to understand online tool. This will be a living tool. We are continuing our research and will keep updating the tool until it is ready to go public.
