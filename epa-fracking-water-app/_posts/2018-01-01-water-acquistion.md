title: "Water Acquisition"
menu-item: "Water Acquisition"
definition: "The withdrawal of groundwater or surface water to make hydraulic fracturing fluids."
water-impact: "Groundwater and surface water resources that provide water for hydraulic fracturing fluids can also provide drinking water for public or non-public water supplies. If, however, multiple oil and gas production wells are located within an area, the total volume of water needed to hydraulically fracture all of the wells has the potential to be a significant portion of the water available and impacts on drinking water resources can occur."

	    	<h3>Risk Factors</h3>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>Is your area experiencing a time of low water availability? Look at the drought data and well water levels.</li>
	    		<li>Are there a high concentration of active wells?</li>
	    		<li>Is there a large percentage of water use going towards oil and gas?</li>
	    		<li>If the answer to all of these questions is no, your water is at less risk of impacts from hydraulic fracturing.</li>
